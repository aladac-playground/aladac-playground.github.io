Because I was swarmed at my current job I could not properly followup. I decided to do some research about Toptal and after liking what I found out I decided to register. I tend to experiment a lot in my free time. Sometimes these experiments yield results in form of hobby projects released on github.

I honestly do not remember how I stumbled upon this site.
Probably found it on either r/programming
or on Hacker News.

I really like Codecademy. I started poking around
it some time ago, focusing mainly on the Python entry course.

Recently I returned to the site and done some JavaScript
and Ruby examples.

Even though these were very basic lessons it was still very fun
and satisfying to complete them.

I intend on coming back to Codecademy to complete
more courses in the near future.

              <p>Sometimes it is easier to analyze your data models when they are visualized. Whether you analyze your models, collaborate with someone or just plainly need to explain to the customer
how you understood the business concept - diagrams help a lot.</p>

<p>When things like <code class="highlighter-rouge">rdoc</code>, <code class="highlighter-rouge">sdoc</code> or <code class="highlighter-rouge">yard</code> encourage and make documenting your work easier I was wondering if there is a tools that deals with ERM in a similar fashion.</p>

<p>Well, as I have found out on numerous occasions when dealing with Ruby related issues the answer to most <em>“Wonder if there is a … ?”</em> questions is <em>“Yup!”</em>.</p>

              <p>Okay, so you’ve got your <a href="https://www.spotify.com">Spotify</a> premium account and are in a situation where a device able to play music better than your mobile, tablet or laptop is present.
Sadly, the device neither has a Spotify client, nor uPnP media player or AirPlay capabilities…</p>

<p><a href="http://macromates.com/">TextMate</a> is great. My most favourite TextMate feature are the Snippets.
What is a Snippet? A Snippet is a piece of code that defines the editors helpful behaviour in a given context.
Sounds complicated? Well it’s really not.</p>

              <p>I love Google. I truly do. Not because of all the “free” stuff they let you use, but because of the endless supply of development tools and resources one can get from them. Be that <a href="http://www.google.com/webfonts">Web Fonts</a> or <a href="https://developers.google.com/speed/libraries/">Hosted libraries</a> or their <a href="https://developers.google.com/products/">SDK’s and API’s</a>.</p>

<p>I recently came across a tutorial on writing your own Chrome extensions, and frankly was surprised how easy it came out be. I recommend reading the <a href="http://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted.html">tutorial</a>.</p>

              <p>I like to have my news sources aggregated when reading on my mobile devices. Up until recently my weapon of choice was <a href="https://www.pulse.me/" target="_blank">Pulse News.</a> It still is a great reader but it has become a little too bloated for my taste. After a short fling with <a href="https://www.google.com/producer/currents" target="_blank">Google Currents</a> I have found a suitable replacement for Pulse.</p>

              <p>I really have no idea how Nintendo manages to pull this off. My 6 year old DS Lite is one of my favorite gadgets of all time(of all time! thanks Kanye). </p>
<p></p>
<p>Currently most smartphones have more CPU/GPU whoomp than the DS Lite, but you just can't beat the taste of the little Nintendo flavors that come with their handheld consoles. I don't know about your average DS owner but I bought mine for the content - one I won't be able to see on any other platform (except maybe running a DS emulator on it). </p>

              I finally got my hands on Death Rally PC, and what was supposed to be taking a peak at what it looks like, turned into a 4 hour gaming session :)

To say that I enjoyed the original would be an understatement. 

I already logged my share of time on the mobile version of Death Rally, but the PC version is significantly more fun. 

IMHO 7,64 EUR well spent.

              I remember the times when playing a multiplayer game was not very easy. During the times that DOS was the dominant home OS, most multiplayer sessions invlolved a serial cable and taking a PC to the place the gaming took part at. If you were lucky enough to have access to a LAN populated by other willing players, you were one happy camper. If you would like to relive those multiplayer moments with some friends from the old days, DOSBox is there for you, with its IPX emulation. I already tried out Death Rally and it worked like a charm....

              There is a nice and clean way to embed subtitles to your iTunes videos without the need of transcoding the video. The program is called subler. Of course there are numerous ways you can play video with subtitles on a Mac with much less hassle, but if you for some reason want to use iTunes to play or share videos on your home network this a neat and fast way to add subtitles to your videos. Besides being able to convert SRT subtitles to the 3GPP format, the software can also transcode audio (using Perian) from formats that are unwelcome...

              I happen to sometimes use more than one computer terminal at once. While I am compiling something on my Linux box I can be playing World of Warcraft on my Mac.

You can actually setup your multi-computer environment without a hardware KVM.

The software allowing you to do that is called Synergy and is available for Windows, Linux and Mac.
